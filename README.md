Learning the ropes of github

Retired for the last decade and now living on a small farm near Kaukapakapa, Auckland, New Zealand.
I am learning about restorative agriculture and attempting to apply what I learn to a small area of nearly flat land which I aim to turn into a garden and orchard area using no-till, cover-crop procedures. I used pigs to root up the pasture last season but will have to do without their help this season.
In the past I have had a hobby of running Linux on my computer(s) and currently use Linux Mint MATE 18.1
