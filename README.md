Learning the ropes of github

Retired for the last decade and now living on a small farm near Kaukapakapa, Auckland, New Zealand.
I am learning about restorative agriculture and attempting to apply what I learn to a small area of nearly flat land which I aim to turn into a garden and orchard using no-till, cover-crop procedures. I used pigs to root up the pasture last season but will have to do without their help this season.
In the past I have had a hobby of running Linux on my computer(s) and currently use Linux Mint MATE 18.1

In the past I tried to document what I was learning in my own Wiki at http://pgtips91.pbworks.com/w/page/10961864/FrontPage where much of what I learned and probably now forgotten still remains as a searchable resoruce that I occasionally use to refresh my memory of stuff. Memory, or the loss of it, is one of my disabilities that I struggle with a lot.

One of my interests since moving onto the farm has been to document the wildlife and vegitation on the farm and in the surrounding area. My observations may be viewed at https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/pgtips91

I have joint github because I started looking at Qubes OS, discovered that the links to their Wiki are all broken and wanted to get involved to resolve that issue.
